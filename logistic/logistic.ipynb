    "The dataset i'll be using is a very interesting one called **\"Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database.\"**  \n",
    "Which contains: <center>*\"Features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.\"*</center><center>*\"They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.\"*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In breif, it's a datset that contains 33 features with the target value classifying a patient's tumor as \"Malignent\" or \"Benign\".  \n",
    "Since the target array ${y}$ currently contains \"M\" for malignent and \"B\" for benign, we'll turn the array into boolean form with M = 1 and B = 0.  \n",
