# 📈 ML Regression Models from Scratch

This repository contains my personal implementations of core regression models using only **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**, without relying on machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn` or pre-written course notebooks. All models were written from scratch to solidify my understanding of the underlying mathematics and algorithms.

> ✨ Inspired by the [Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction), but completely written independently using documentation and mathematical intuition.
